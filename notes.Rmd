# notes on dataviz and sketches

## moving data 
*15th May 2017*
We were at the hospital looking at the ecography of our new coming son. We were looking for possibile sympthoms of the *spina bifida*.
The doctor moved the ecographer a bit around the ending part of the spine and it was clear it was a close spine.
Then it took a photo of the same spine.
From the photo you wouldn't have undestand that it was a close spine and even that it was a spine.
This let me understand that movies are better than photographs to understand an object, even if just providing small movement around the object. 
Moving around the data, could we?
