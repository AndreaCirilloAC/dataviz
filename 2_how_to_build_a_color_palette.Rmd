# how to build a color palette from any custom image
## (and yeah, there is a package for that)

gancio con storia

##what you are going to find here
the post will give you a clear view of how the task was automated, providing detail of the clustering algorithm employed. It will moreover show you a small R package which was developed to ease the application of this process from other users. Finally use cases for the considered algo will be provided, from the most intuitive ggplot2 employment to the more advanced one.
## behind the scenes: k-means for image processing
I have to be honest: my first thinking when dealing with this task was not the one I am going to show you. I was actually getting lost following a bad path mad of triples of Red Green and Blues, trying to select from frequency tables the most representative ones. But suddenly, after reading a blog post about k-means algorithm the idea was born: let k-means divide the picture into homogeneous clusters, having each one a "center" constituted by an RGB triple and from this way define a palett representative of the picture itself.

### the k-means algorithm
to let you maxmismise the fun coming from the rest of the post we have to see here briefly what the k-means clustering algorithm is. This algo is a way to divide a given set of data into k groups/clusters, where k stands for a number, like usually n does.
How do we do that? The basic and elegant way behind the algorythm is: measure the difference between data points and lookf or the clusterisation which minimise this difference within clusters. The typical measure employed ere is the euclidean distance, and particularly the *squared euclidean distance*. We measure with it the distance between points, and we can expand it from 1 to n dimensions. That is why it turns to be effective with such kind of problems where populations can be pertaining to multidimensional spaces. Making it less wordy, let us look at the formula behind the distance. Given two points of a three dimension space $P=(p_{x},p_{y},p_{z})$  and $Q=(q_{x},q_{y},q_{z})$ this distance is measured as the square of the distance between the three couples of coordinates raised to the second:

$$ {\sqrt  {(p_{x}-q_{x})^{2}+(p_{y}-q_{y})^{2}+(p_{z}-q_{z})^{2}}} $$
Now that we know the measure we want to minimize let us have a look at how to find the best possible clusterisation. The typical way adopted from k-means algorithm is working on iterations:

- *(a)*: first iteration randomically assign a cluster to each data point
- *(b)*: then it measure the centroid for every cluster
- *(c)*: change cluster assignation moving each data point to the cluster which have the centroid closer to the data point
- *(d)*: measure the euclidean distance within clusters and sum it up to measure the performance of the given clusterisation
- *(e)*: iterate *(b)*, *(c)* and *(d)* until the last step does not obtain a lower sum of distances.

You may be wondering what exactly a centroid it. To get it just think it is the barycenter of a given set of point. It is the point which minimise the euclidean distance between him and the other points within the group. for a given set of $n$ points in a $\mathbb {R} ^{n} $ space we measure it as follow:

$$ \mathbf {C} ={\frac {\mathbf {x} _{1}+\mathbf {x} _{2}+\cdots +\mathbf {x} _{n}}{n}} $$
Now that we now what a k-means algorithm is, how do we apply it to an image?

### applying the k-means algorithm to an image

getting a closer look to an image we find it can be decomposed into reasonably small points, each of which is of a single colour. This is what for instance the pointillisme thought a long time before pc's when started paointing on canvas not meshing their colours in greater or smaller colour fields but as small points one next to the other. Take for instance this famous painting from seurat:

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Georges_Seurat_-_Un_dimanche_après-midi_à_l%27île_de_la_Grande_Jatte.jpg" width ="400px"/>

Decomposing an image to its constitutent points is the first needed step to apply on it every kind of statistical, algorithmical or matematical concept. Once this is done, at least within our mind, we have to find a way to identify every single point. This is easily done in the space, since we are dealing with flat images and the good old cartesian x-y couple will be enough.
But what about colours? we are looking here for a way to derive a palette from every kind of possible image, shouldn't we find a way to "measure" the color o the points? We can resort here to the RGB codification, a convenient way to measure colours firstly introduced during the '800 which become popular during the age of televisions and electronical monitors (you know, they need a way to measur ecolours too).

Following this theory there are three primary additive colours: Red, Green and Blue. Each colour can be therefore be decomposed into a triple of this colours. look for instance at this dark red:

*image here*

following RGB codification scheme we can decompose it as follow:

- Red XX
- Green XX
- Blue XX

as you can see we now have an objective way to measure and describe colours. We can therefore take our picture and describe it as a set of points each of which with a codified colour, in terms of Red Green and Blue. Let us try to do it for real, importing an image into our R environment

#### read the image

as is often the case within the R world, we have a package which helps us importing an image and decomposing it into points each of which codified in the terms of the RGB system. This package is the jpeg package, developed by [Simon Urbanek](http://urbanek.info). Once the package is installed you can run the readJPEG to import and decompose every kind of .jpeg image. within our example we are going to employ the *Sacra Famiglia Canigiana* painting by Raffaello, which contains a wonderful set of vivid colours coming from its studies on the unione paitning technique.

<img src="https://andreacirilloac.github.io/dataviz/images/sacra_famiglia_canigiani.jpg" width ="400px"/>

To employ it we have to download it into our environment, whic can be easily done via the *download.file()* function. Once we are done with this we can apply the readJPEG function described above, assigning the result to the *painting* object

```{r image_download}
download.file("https://andreacirilloac.github.io/dataviz/images/sacra_famiglia_canigiani.jpg", "image.jpg")
painting     <- readJPEG("image.jpg")
```

We now have an object, called painting, composed by a set of triples, where each triple is a combination of Red Green and Blue.

#### run k-means

### dealing with results

### show the palette

## paletter package to replicate the process
One of the best gifts the R community gave to me is the tons of packages which helped me with nearly every one of my data mining activity. This is why I often try to translate my code into packages, especially when it contains some functions which could be useful for someone. This I think is the case for the processing steps we have seen before, as we will see later on. 
For this reason you can find on Github a packge named paletter, which is currently with just one not-so-badly documented function. Paletter is freely available (of course...) and you can install it running the following>

```{r install_paletter}
library(devtools)
install_github("andreacirilloac/paletter")
```

once you will be done with the installation the actual application of the algo will be even easier, requiring you to run the *palette_maker* function, which takes as input the path to the picture and the number of colours you are wishing to derive from it:

```{r palette_maker_example}
library(paletter)
download.file("https://andreacirilloac.github.io/dataviz/images/sacra_famiglia_canigiani.jpg", "image.jpg")
colours_vector <- palette_maker("image.jpg", number_of_colors = 32)
```
